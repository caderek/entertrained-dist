Jacobsen","language":"en","description":"A young, disillusioned poet struggles to find love and meaning in 19th century Denmark.","longDescription":["Niels Lyhne, an aspiring poet, is torn between the romanticism and faith of the old tradition, and modern notions of realism and reason. His relationship with different women, including his young aunt Edele, a free spirit of Copenhagen, and Mrs. Boye, a passionate artist, only lead him to further disillusionment as he searches for meaning in a rapidly changing world.","Published in 1880, Niels Lyhne, Jacobsen's second novel, was not as well received as his first, neither by reviewers nor the public. There wasn't a second printing until after his death in 1885."],"year":2023,"genres":["fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
