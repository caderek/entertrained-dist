    "The eccentric and entertaining Mr. Mulliner is always ready with a tale for his willing audience at the Anglers' Rest pub. He's a master storyteller, and, in the finest tradition of fishermen everywhere, his stories are absolute whoppers, each featuring his illustrious - and sometimes outlandish - relatives. The Mulliners are, to a person, witty, talented, and unflappable, and yet they continually find themselves in the sort of pickles that only P. G. Wodehouse could create.",
