{"id":"oscar-wilde--the-picture-of-dorian-gray","title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","titleAlpha":"picture of dorian gray","author":"Oscar Wilde","language":"en","description":"A Victorian dandy turns to a life of debauchery after a magical portrait stops him from aging.","longDescription":["The Picture of Dorian Gray was first published as a serial in Lippencott's Monthly Magazine, and the publishers thought it would so offend readers that they removed nearly 500 words without Wilde's approval. Wilde soon expanded it and republished it as a novel, including a short preface justifying his art. Even though his contemporaries considered it so offensive that some argued for his prosecution, Dorian Gray today survives as a classic philosophical novel that explores themes of aestheticism and double lives. Couched in Wilde's trademark cutting wit, Dorian Gray is still being adapted today, with Dorian and his moldering portrait remaining cultural touchstones."],"year":2014,"genres":["fiction","philosophy"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
