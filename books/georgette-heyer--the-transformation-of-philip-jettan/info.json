The titular Philip Jettan is an unpolished young country gentleman in love with Cleone. Cleone is also in love with him, but wishes he were more sophisticated. Due to poor communication and insecurity on both their parts, she rejects him, and he sets off to attempt to transform himself into the fashionable gentleman she desires.","Transformation is an example of an early romance novel. It was the only novel Heyer published under a pseudonym (as \"Stella Martin\"), and, according to one source, it was written in just three weeks. In 1930 it was republished as Powder and Patch, but without the last chapter."],"year":1923,"genres":["classics","fiction","romance"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
