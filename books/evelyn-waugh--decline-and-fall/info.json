{"id":"evelyn-waugh--decline-and-fall","title":"Decline and Fall","titleAlpha":"decline and fall","author":"Evelyn Waugh","language":"en","description":"A young man is drummed out of his College and in turn becomes a schoolmaster.","longDescription":["Paul Pennyfeather is a second-year theology student who, as a result of mistaken identity, has his \"education discontinued for personal reasons.\" He ends up as a schoolmaster at a fourth-rate school, hired despite not meeting any of the qualifications in their advertisement. He there encounters a cornucopia of eccentric characters, including another master who has a wooden leg, a former clergyman with capital-D Doubts, and a servant who tells everyone he's rich, but with a different tale for each about why he's posing as a servant. Paul's time at school leads to romance with a student's mother, and that in turn leads to enormous complications in Paul's life.","Inspired in part by his own experiences in school and as a schoolmaster, Evelyn Waugh's first published novel, Decline and Fall, is a dark and occasionally farcical satire of British college life. It's something of a perverse coming-of-age story, subverting the expected journey and ending that the archetype usually demands. Shining a devastating light on many of the societal struggles of post-WWI Britain, Waugh took his novel's title from another work that revealed the ineluctable descent of a great society: Gibbons' The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.","Waugh issued a new edition of Decline and Fall in 1960 that contained restored text that was removed by his publisher from the first edition.
