As the dockworkers try to work out what to do, Mr. Leon Felix arrives and claims the cask as his own. His actions set into motion a complicated trail for the detectives of London's Scotland Yard and Paris's Surete to follow to the end.","Freeman Wills Crofts was one of many authors writing crime fiction in Britain in the 1920s and 30s, and was a contemporary and acquaintance of both Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler. The Cask, his first novel, was written during leave from his job as a railway engineer, but its reception was good enough to set Crofts on the course of a further thirty crime novels over his career as an author."],"year":2020,"genres":["fiction","mystery","murder"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
