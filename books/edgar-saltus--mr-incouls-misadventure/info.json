But just as Maida begins to adjust to this unconventional arrangement, the unexpected occurs: at a bullfight in Spain, a former lover resurfaces, vying for her attention once more. Mr. Incoul remains blissfully unaware of this development. Or does he?","In Mr. Incoul's Misadventure, his first published work of fiction, Edgar Saltus eruditely applies the biting pessimism that he previously studied in his philosophical works The Philosophy of Disenchantment and The Anatomy of Negation."],"year":null,"genres":["classics","fiction"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
