John G. Neihardt captures the essence of the American West through the intertwining stories of various historical and mythic figures. As the cycle unfolds, the vivid imagery, rich symbolism, and lyrical verse paint a vivid portrait of pivotal moments in Western history, from the brutal survival story of Hugh Glass in The Song of Hugh Glass to the clashes between settlers and Native Americans in The Song of the Indian Wars.","The Song of Three Friends introduces readers to three trappers - Joe, Fred, and Hugh - whose friendship is tested by the harsh realities of frontier life. Through their experiences, the poem explores camaraderie, survival, and the relentless pursuit of freedom amidst the untamed wilderness.","The Song of Hugh Glass explores the legendary tale of the eponymous Hugh Glass, a fur trapper who survives a brutal bear attack only to be left for dead by his companions. Against all odds, Glass embarks on a journey of vengeance and redemption, embodying the indomitable spirit of the American frontier.","The Song of the Indian Wars delves into the tragic conflict between Native American tribes and the encroaching forces of colonization. Neihardt portrays the complex dynamics of this struggle, highlighting the perspectives of both Native warriors and settlers as they grapple with violence, displacement, and the erosion of traditional ways of life.","The Song of Jed Smith and The Song of the Messiah are not yet in the U. S. public domain, and are therefore not yet included in this edition."],"year":2024,"genres":["history","poetry"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
