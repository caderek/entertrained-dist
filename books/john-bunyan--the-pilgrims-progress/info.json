  "longDescription": [
    "The Pilgrim's Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come was written in 1678 by John Bunyan, a Puritan and a dissenter from the Church of England. It is an allegory of the journey to redemption of the faithful, through many snares and difficulties. Cast in the form of a dream, the first part of the work deals with a man called Christian, who sets off carrying a great burden. He meets many helpers and many adversaries on this journey. The second part of the work deals with Christian's wife, Christiana, and her four children, who follow a similar journey.",
    "One of the most influential of all religious works, The Pilgrim's Progress was immediately popular and has been translated over the years into many languages and into many forms, including verse, opera, movies, and many illustrated versions for children. Several of its story elements, characters and locations have entered the language, such as the \"Slough of Despond,\" \"Vanity Fair,\" \"Great-heart,\" and \"Giant Despair.\"",
    "This edition is based on a version of Bunyan's complete works edited by George Offor and published in 1855. It contains many endnotes drawn from a variety of commentators."
