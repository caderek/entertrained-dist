{"id":"o-henry--short-fiction","title":"Short Fiction","titleAlpha":"short fiction","author":"O. Henry","language":"en","description":"A collection of O. Henry short stories, ordered by date of publication.","longDescription":["William Sydney Porter, known to readers as O. Henry, was a true raconteur. As a draftsman, a bank teller, a newspaper writer, a fugitive from justice in Central America, and a writer living in New York City, he told stories at each stop and about each stop. His stories are known for their vivid characters who come to life, and sometimes death, in only a few pages. But the most famous characteristic of O. Henry's stories are the famous \"twist\" endings, where the outcome comes as a surprise both to the characters and the readers. O. Henry's work was widely recognized and lauded, so much so that a few years after his death an award was founded in his name to recognize the best American short story (now stories) of the year.","This collection gathers all of his available short stories that are in the U. S. public domain. They were published in various popular magazines of the time, as well as in the Houston Post, where they were not attributed to him until many years after his death."],"year":null,"genres":["classics","fiction","shorts"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
