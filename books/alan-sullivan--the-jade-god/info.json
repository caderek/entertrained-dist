  "longDescription": [
    "Writer Jack Derrick and his sister Edith move into a suspiciously inexpensive countryside manor. They quickly discover the reason for their luck - two years earlier an unsolved murder had taken place in the parlor. Jack is extremely sensitive and feels that both the house and the deceased former owner are communicating with him. But to what end?",
    "Alan Sullivan was the winner of Canada's Governor General Award for English-language fiction in 1941 for his novel Three Came to Ville Marie. In The Jade God he blends mystery, mysticism, and romance to create a chilling but ultimately uplifting story of obsession gone wrong."
