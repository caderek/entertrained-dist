In his quest, the philosopher requests the help of the Celtic god of love, experiences catharsis, and is apprehended by policemen tipped off by leprechauns, provoking a second rescue mission - for himself.","It is through this humorous mixture of philosophy and Irish folklore that James Stephens presents deep philosophical questions and social commentary. The novel's meandering plot sets the stage for contrasts between man and woman, city and countryside, and virtue and vice.","First published in 1912, The Crock of Gold is the book that established James Stephens' fame."],"year":2022,"genres":["comedy","fantasy","fiction","philosophy"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
