The remaining Lancastrian leaders are either killed or scattered to the four winds. Within the kingdom, not everyone is happy with their new king - and when Edward falls ill, his power-hungry brother Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, sees his chance and prepares to kill anyone who stands between him and the throne.","Richard puts into play numerous schemes to eradicate the line of succession and control the court. The first victim is King Edward's other brother, Clarence. Rumors lead to Clarence's imprisonment in the Tower of London, and Richard sends two murderers to stab him to death. This causes Edward's health to worsen, and the title of Protector falls to the remaining brother. Next on Richard's hit list is Lord Hastings, the loudest voice to object to Richard's accession, and who is promptly arrested and executed for treason. As Richard orchestrates murder after murder, the deaths start coming back to haunt him.","This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright's 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition."],"year":2021,"genres":["drama","history"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
