This makes the work outdated both scientifically and socially.","Today, the novel is obscured by Jack London's more successful works, like Call of the Wild and Martin Eden."],"year":2023,"genres":["fantasy","fiction","history"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
