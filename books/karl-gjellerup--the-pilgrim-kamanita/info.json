{"id":"karl-gjellerup--the-pilgrim-kamanita","title":"The Pilgrim Kamanita","titleAlpha":"pilgrim kamanita","author":"Karl Gjellerup","language":"en","description":"An Indian merchant's son sets on a pilgrimage after a life of love, loss, business, and pleasure, and unknowingly relates his tale to the Buddha.","longDescription":["Late one night, as he seeks shelter in a potter's entrance hall, Kamanita meets an old ascetic. Encouraged by the monk, he relates the story of his life so far: how, born the son of an Indian merchant, he follows in his father's footsteps; how, on his first trading trip, he meets and loses his great love Vasitthi; how he builds up a fortune and raises a family; and how one day he leaves everything behind to set on a pilgrimage. But the old monk is not who he seems, and when Kamanita refuses to accept his teachings, the consequences are startling and irreversible. What follows is a colorful, bewildering, revelation-filled journey through the past, present, and the Paradise of the West.","Sixteen years before Hermann Hesse published Siddharta, there was another European writer who used Buddhism as a source of inspiration for a novel. After earlier naturalistic works such as Minna and Germanernes Laerling (The German Apprentice), The Pilgrim Kamanita was a stylistic turning point for the Dane Karl Gjellerup. It became a worldwide success, and his subsequent novels would touch on Buddhism as well."],"year":2023,"genres":["fiction","spirituality"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
