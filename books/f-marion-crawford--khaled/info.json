This puts him under scrutiny from the powers above, who curse him to live as a human. Since genies have no souls, he will vanish from existence when he dies; but, if he can find true love, he'll be granted a soul and thus be allowed into heaven.","Written in the style of the \"oriental romances\" popular in those days, Khaled was F. Marion Crawford's favorite novel out of all of the ones he wrote in his successful career."],"year":2017,"genres":["fantasy","fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
