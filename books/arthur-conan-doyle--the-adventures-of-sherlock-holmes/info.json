  "longDescription": [
    "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was the first collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories Conan Doyle published in book form, following the popular success of the novels A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of the Four, which introduced the characters of Dr. John Watson and the austere analytical detective Sherlock Holmes.",
    "The collection contains twelve stories, all originally published in The Strand Magazine between July 1891 and June 1892. Narrated by the first-person voice of Dr. Watson, they involve him and Holmes solving a series of mysterious cases.",
    "Some of the more well-known stories in this collection are \"A Scandal in Bohemia,\" in which Holmes comes up against a worthy opponent in the form of Irene Adler, whom Holmes forever after admiringly refers to as the woman; \"The Redheaded League,\" involving a bizarre scheme offering a well-paid sinecure to redheaded men; and \"The Speckled Band,\" in which Holmes and Watson save a young woman from a terrible death."
