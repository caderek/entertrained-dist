    "John Minute, formerly an unscrupulous African mining magnate, has flown to England, but can't escape his past. Constantly threatened by blackmailers, he fears death and financial ruin. At the suggestion of the commissioner of police, \"The Man Who Knows\" is hired to assist in determining the source of these threats.",
