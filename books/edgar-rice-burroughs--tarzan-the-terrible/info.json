There Tarzan faces new challenges and dangers, including savage dinosaurs and powerful prehistoric creatures. As he navigates through this perilous world, Tarzan becomes embroiled in the conflicts between different tribal factions, as well as the intrigues of the cities that dot the landscape. As Tarzan battles against hostile forces and navigates these intricate power dynamics, readers are taken on a roller-coaster ride of suspense and discovery.","Continuing on from the events of Tarzan the Untamed, Tarzan the Terrible was first published as a seven-part serial in Argosy All-Story Weekly in 1921 before being published as a book by A. C. McClurg & Co.. Standing as a testament to Edgar Rice Burroughs' imaginative storytelling with its mix of adventure, romance, and primal conflicts, the novel is considered by some to be the best entry in the Tarzan series."],"year":1921,"genres":["adventure","fantasy","fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
