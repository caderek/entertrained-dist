While Diamond learns much about life through his travels with North Wind, his visit to the country at her \"back\" proves to be transformative. As life in London grows especially hard, that moment provides Diamond with the resources to touch those around him with beauty and truth.","Although At the Back of the North Wind was written for children, in it MacDonald deals with deep themes, especially the potential for suffering to be redemptive, and the meaning of death."],"year":2004,"genres":["classics","fantasy"],"topics":["fairy-tales","folklore"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
