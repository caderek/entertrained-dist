This peace, though, is broken when the younger brother Jean is left a life-changing inheritance by Marechel, an old family friend - and Pierre is left with nothing. Despite the happiness in the rest of the family, unanswered questions start gnawing at Pierre.","Pierre and Jean was Guy de Maupassant's shortest novel, and is often acclaimed as his greatest. The setting for the novel is the scenery of de Maupassant's childhood, and it is, accordingly, richly described. It was serialized in Nouvelle Revue in 1887 before being published as a complete novel in 1888; this edition is based on the 1902 translation by Clara Bell."],"year":2020,"genres":["fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
