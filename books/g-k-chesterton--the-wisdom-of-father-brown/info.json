K. Chesterton's crime-solving Catholic priest, is back in this second collection of Father Brown short stories.","In this collection, Brown is joined by his sidekick, the former arch-criminal Flambeau. Brown is directly involved in the investigations less frequently than in The Innocence of Father Brown, and several of the stories don't even feature murder. Despite this, the shorts each feature Brown solving a mystery using his characteristic insight into human nature and morality.","The stories in this collection were initially published in various serials, including McClure's Magazine and The Pall Mall Magazine. Chesterton arranged them in this collection almost in order of publication."],"year":1914,"genres":["fiction","mystery","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
