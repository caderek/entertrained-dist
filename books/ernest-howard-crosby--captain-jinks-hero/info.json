Crosby, who corresponded with Leo Tolstoy and advocated Tolstoy's pacifist ideals in the United States, lambasts the American military and its involvement in the Spanish-American War and the Boxer Rebellion through the character of Captain Jinks, a jingoistic officer who embarks on a tragicomic quest to become a \"perfect soldier.\" The novel also satirizes the role of industrial and media interests in promoting war through the character of Jinks's friend and companion Cleary, a yellow journalist who feeds sensational stories back to the home front at the behest of editors and monopolists."],"year":2021,"genres":["fiction","satire"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
