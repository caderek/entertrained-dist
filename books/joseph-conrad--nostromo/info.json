Giovanni Battista Fidanza, known as Nostromo, is given the task of smuggling out a large amount of silver to keep it from the revolutionaries.","Conrad was inspired to write the book when he read, in a sailor's memoir, the tale of a man who singlehandedly stole a boatload of silver. He had first heard the same story a quarter of a century earlier as a young sailor.","Nostromo has met with critical acclaim: it is often regarded as Conrad's greatest novel and Francis Scott Fitzgerald said he would rather have written Nostromo than any other novel."],"year":2018,"genres":["fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
