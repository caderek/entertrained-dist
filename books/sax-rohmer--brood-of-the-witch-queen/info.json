{"id":"sax-rohmer--brood-of-the-witch-queen","title":"Brood of the Witch-Queen","titleAlpha":"brood of the witch-queen","author":"Sax Rohmer","language":"en","description":"A father and son duo investigate a man who is wielding ancient Egyptian magic.","longDescription":["Perhaps best known for creating the character Fu-Manchu, Sax Rohmer is also known for his works involving the supernatural. This novel follows Robert Cairn, his father, Dr. Bruce Cairn, and their suspicion of one Antony Ferrara.","After witnessing the strange and violent death of a swan, Robert Cairn suspects that Ferrara may be involved with the death of the bird. Soon after two murders, Dr. Bruce Cairn arrives in London and warns Robert that he suspects Ferrara is using ancient Egyptian magic to accomplish his evil deeds. After a mystical attack on Robert, Dr. Cairn and his son become involved in a series of supernatural events as they work to prevent Antony Ferrara from inflicting his dark magic on more victims.","Like many of his works, Rohmer includes exotic locations in this novel; first set in London, the action soon moves to the pyramids of Egypt as the father and son duo track down Ferrara. Having received both success and notoriety from Fu-Manchu, Rohmer has been given praise for Brood of the Witch-Queen, such as when H. P. Lovecraft favorably compared it to Bram Stoker's Dracula."],"year":2019,"genres":["fiction","horror"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
