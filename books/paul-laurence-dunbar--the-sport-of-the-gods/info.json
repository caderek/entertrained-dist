  "longDescription": [
    "The Sport of the Gods is a novel set in the United States in the late nineteenth century. It chronicles the tribulations of the Oakleys, an African American family of four, as they struggle to survive and maintain their integrity in a Southern town and then in New York City. Prejudice, provincialism, and temptation take their tolls, and the justice system stands ever ready to grab the losers.",
    "This was Paul Laurence Dunbar's final novel, published first in the May 1901 issue of Lipincott's Monthly Magazine. In 1902, Dodd, Mead & Co. published it as a book."
