Over twelve short chapters the reader follows Siddhartha through his time as a young adult, to his exploration of spirituality as a traveling ascetic, to his delvings in lust, business, and greed, to his time as an old man. At each stage of his life Siddhartha yearns for nirvana, finally achieving it only after realizing that it's all of life's experiences that form it, not the teachings of any one man.","Today Siddhartha remains an influential text in new Western spirituality."],"year":2015,"genres":["fiction","philosophy","spirituality"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
