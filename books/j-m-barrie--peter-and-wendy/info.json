Wendy's two brothers, John and Michael, accompany them on their many adventures, including skirmishes with the Native Americans who reside there, and battles with pirates, led by Pan's nemesis Captain Hook, who is said to be feared even by Captain Flint and Long John Silver.","Peter and Wendy, J. M. Barrie's most famous work, was influenced by Barrie's relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family and the death of his older brother, who, by dying in his youth, would remain a young boy forever. It began as a play first performed in 1904, and then was later published as a novel in 1911. A large number of adaptations including plays, television, and films have since been produced."],"year":1911,"genres":["children","fantasy","fiction","pirates"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
