{"id":"ben-jonson--the-alchemist","title":"The Alchemist","titleAlpha":"alchemist","author":"Ben Jonson","language":"en","description":"A rollicking Elizabethan comedy in which two con men and their female compatriot gull a series of unfortunate victims out of their money.","longDescription":["First performed in 1610, The Alchemist is one of Ben Jonson's greatest comedies. Written for the King's Men - the acting company to which Shakespeare belonged - it was first performed in Oxford because the playhouses in London were closed due to the plague. It was an immediate success and has remained a popular staple ever since.","The play centers around a con man, his female accomplice, and a roguish butler who uses his master's house to gull a series of victims out of their money and goods. Jonson uses the play to satirize as many people as he can - pompous lords, greedy commoners, and self-righteous Anabaptists alike - as his three con artists proceed to bilk everyone who comes to their door. They don multiple roles and weave elaborate tales to exploit their victims' greed and amass a small fortune. But it all comes to a sudden, raucous end when the master unexpectedly returns to London and all the victims gather to try and reclaim their property."],"year":2019,"genres":["comedy","drama"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
