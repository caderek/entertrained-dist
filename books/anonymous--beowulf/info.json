{"id":"anonymous--beowulf","title":"Beowulf","titleAlpha":"beowulf","author":"Anonymous","language":"en","description":"A hero is hired to kill a monster that has been plaguing the land.","longDescription":["Horothgar, King of the Danes, invites warriors from neighboring kingdoms to his great mead hall with the hope that one of them will solve his problem. A monster named Grendel has been terrorizing the land and killing his people. One of the warriors who answers this call is our epic hero, Beowulf.","The Beowulf Manuscript, also known as the Nowell Codex, dates back to the late 10th century or early 11th century and is the only copy in existence. In 1731, the manuscript was damaged from the Cotton Library fire, making several lines in the poem unreadable. Today, with the help of modern technology, advanced techniques are being used not only to preserve the document from further degradation but also to reveal missing letters. All this is done to ensure that this epic story will continue to live on for many more generations."],"year":2019,"genres":["dragons","horror","poetry"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
