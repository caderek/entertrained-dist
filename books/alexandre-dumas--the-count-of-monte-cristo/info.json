{"id":"alexandre-dumas--the-count-of-monte-cristo","title":"The Count of Monte Cristo","titleAlpha":"count of monte cristo","author":"Alexandre Dumas","language":"en","description":"A man seeks revenge for having been falsely imprisoned years earlier.","longDescription":["Edmond Dantes is a young man about to be made captain of a cargo vessel and marry his sweetheart. But he is arrested at his pre-wedding feast, having been falsely accused of being a Bonapartist. Thrown into the notorious Chateau d'If prison, he eventually meets an ancient inmate who teaches him language, science, and passes hints of a hidden fortune. When Edmond makes his way out of prison, he plots to reward those who stood by him (his old employer, for one), and to seek revenge on the men who betrayed him: one who wrote the letter that denounced him, one that married his fiancee in his absence, and one who knew Dantes was innocent but stood idly by and did nothing.","The Count of Monte Cristo is another of Alexandre Dumas' thrilling adventure stories, possibly more popular even than The Three Musketeers. Originally serialized in a French newspaper over the course of a year-and-a-half, it was enormously popular after its publication in book form, and has never been out of print since. Its timeless story of adventure, historical drama, romance, revenge, and Eastern mystery has been the source of over forty movies and TV series."],"year":2021,"genres":["adventure","fiction","history","pirates","revenge"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
