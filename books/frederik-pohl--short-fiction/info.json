The stories were published between 1942 and 1962, with some of them set in what feels like the same era in which they were written. Pohl's work is very human-centered, often with only minimal futuristic or speculative elements.","Pohl used pseudonyms for some of these short stories, including James MacCreigh, Paul Flehr, and Dirk Wylie."],"year":2023,"genres":["fiction","science-fiction","shorts","travel"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
