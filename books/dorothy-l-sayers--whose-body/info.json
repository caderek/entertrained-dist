Sayers","language":"en","description":"An aristocratic detective unravels the mystery of a body deposited in a bathtub in 1920s England.","longDescription":["Whose Body?, published in 1923, is the first in a long and very popular series of mystery novels written by Dorothy L. Sayers and featuring her aristocratic detective Lord Peter Wimsey.","In this novel we are introduced to Wimsey, his imperturbable and multi-skilled butler Bunter, and his close friend Charles Parker of Scotland Yard as they come together to investigate an extremely mysterious incident: the naked body of a man, wearing a golden pince-nez, has been discovered in the bath of a bewildered tenant of a flat in Battersea. There's a good deal of humor in the book, carefully balanced against the grim reality of murder.","Whose Body? was well-received on first publication, and provided a basis for Sayer's successful career as a novelist. In sum, she wrote some eleven Wimsey novels as well as several short stories featuring the characters. Nevertheless, it appears that she herself felt that her translation of Dante's Divine Comedy was her greatest literary work."],"year":1923,"genres":["fiction","mystery","murder"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
