Are the ghosts the governess sees real, or are they figments of her quiet insanity?","The Turn of the Screw was originally published as a serial, and later went through many revisions by James himself. Though there aren't any overt suggestion that James intended his novella to be anything but a simple ghost story, the ambiguity in the narrative has captured the imagination of generations of readers and critics."],"year":2014,"genres":["children","fiction","horror"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
