They spend the evening in a small village, and when they investigate a large empty house nearby, they hear a woman singing from within. McCann's companion recognizes the woman's voice as belonging to a Russian princess he had worshiped from afar when he was stationed in Europe. A gang of street-urchins inform the pair that the princess and her companion are held prisoner, and all agree to join forces and effect a rescue.","The book was made into a silent movie in 1928, and has also been adapted for radio."],"year":1922,"genres":["adventure","classics","fiction"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
