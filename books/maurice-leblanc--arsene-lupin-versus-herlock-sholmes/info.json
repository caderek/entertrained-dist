More a loving homage than a straight copy, Herlock Sholmes (changed just enough to avoid fallout from a copyright claim by Conan Doyle) and his companion Wilson are summoned to France initially to throw light on the case of the Blonde Lady. Having encountered Arsene Lupin before, Sholmes is only too happy to get a chance of revenge.","This collection of two stories were originally serialised in the magazine Je Sais Tout from 1906 to 1907, and were translated into English in 1910. After an earlier story with an unauthorised Sherlock Holmes, Maurice Leblanc was forced to rename his antagonist for these stories."],"year":1908,"genres":["adventure","fiction","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
