In this book, the author attempts to provoke a discussion by posing different problems.","The book covers a wide variety of theories proposed by philosophers like Plato, Descartes, Hume, Aristotle, etc. In view of these theories, Russell poses questions about the nature of reality and our perception of it.","While the book refrains from providing absolute solutions to the problems it describes, it excels in guiding the readers towards developing their own way of thinking."],"year":1912,"genres":["classics","nonfiction","philosophy"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
