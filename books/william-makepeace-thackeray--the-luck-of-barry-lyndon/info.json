{"id":"william-makepeace-thackeray--the-luck-of-barry-lyndon","title":"The Luck of Barry Lyndon","titleAlpha":"luck of barry lyndon","author":"William Makepeace Thackeray","language":"en","description":"A poor Irish rogue tries to win fame and fortune in the 18th-century English aristocracy.","longDescription":["The Luck of Barry Lyndon was first published as a serial in Fraser's Magazine, then later as a complete volume entitled The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq. - a title Thackeray disliked, but that was selected by his publisher. Thackeray had great difficulty composing the novel, and found himself frequently frustrated in his attempts to get Barry out of yet another jam. Ultimately he was displeased with his work, and considered it one of his lesser novels.","Despite Thackeray's neglect, Barry Lyndon is a bright satire filled with many genuinely funny moments. Barry is the quintessential unreliable narrator, and through his outrageous boasts and tall tales he becomes not just the target of the satire, but its very agent as well. Fortunately modern critics have viewed Barry Lyndon in a much more favorable light than Thackeray's contemporaries, and even Thackeray himself: today it's considered by some critics as one of his finest works."],"year":1844,"genres":["classics","comedy","fiction","satire"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
