Black's gritty portrayal of life \"on the road\" and inside account of the criminal justice system helped inspire Beat Generation writers like William S. Burroughs, and played an influential role in prison reform efforts long after its publication."],"year":2022,"genres":["autobiography","crime"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
