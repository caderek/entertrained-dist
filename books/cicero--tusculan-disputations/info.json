They take the form of fictional dialogues between Cicero and his friends, with each one focusing on a particular Stoic theme. The first, \"On the Contempt of Death,\" reminds us that mortality is nothing to be upset about. The second, \"On Bearing Pain,\" reassures us that philosophy is a balm for pains of the body. The third and fourth, \"On Grief of Mind\" and \"Other Perturbations of the Mind,\" say that this extends also to mental anguish and unrest. The last, \"Whether Virtue Alone Be Sufficient for a Happy Life,\" tells us that the key to happiness is already in our hands: it is not to rely on accidents of fate, but on our own efforts in areas of life that are under our own control."],"year":2020,"genres":["philosophy"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
