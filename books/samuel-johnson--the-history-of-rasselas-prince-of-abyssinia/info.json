While the plot is basic and the characters are thin, the work is an important philosophical piece exploring whether or not humanity can attain happiness.","Rasselas, an Abyssinian prince, travels with his sister Nekayah, her handmaiden Pekuah, and the wise poet Imlac - a proxy for Johnson himself. Their exploration of happiness and the meaning of leading a happy life is a complex and subtle one, though the work ends with \"nothing concluded.\" Johnson leaves the reader to ponder: Can an individual ever attain happiness in any meaningful sense?"],"year":2016,"genres":["fiction","satire"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
