The centerpiece is the long poem \"New Hampshire,\" an ode to the state. Endnotes on its lines point to shorter poems in the \"Notes\" section, and the book is capped with \"Grace Notes,\" a series of short lyrics - some of which are among Frost's most famous works. The poems are each a meditative brushstroke of Americana, presented in Frost's trademark plain-spoken but carefully-considered verse. The collection went on to win the 1924 Pulitzer prize for poetry, the first of four Frost would go on to receive.","Included in this book is \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" \"Fire and Ice,\" and \"Nothing Gold Can Stay.\""],"year":2020,"genres":["poetry"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
