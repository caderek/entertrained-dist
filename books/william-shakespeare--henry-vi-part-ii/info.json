The Duke of Gloucester discovers that the French forces are allowed to keep the territories of Anjou and Maine in a trade for Margaret; he foresees that England will lose what little control remains over France. Because Gloucester heavily influences King Henry VI's decisions and is highly respected amongst his peers, he is seen as a major target.","Cardinal Beaufort, Gloucester's main rival, mentions to Buckingham and Somerset his interest in removing Gloucester. The Duke of York sees Gloucester's death as an opportunity to grab the English throne for himself. The French are also in favor of removing Gloucester from power. For Queen Margaret and the Duke of Suffolk to manipulate the king and help France, Henry's most loyal advisor must not stand in their way.","This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright's 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition."],"year":1597,"genres":["classics","drama","history"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
