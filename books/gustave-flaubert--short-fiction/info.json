It is written in a play format - though sometimes referred to as a prose poem - and features a conversation between Death, Satan and Nero. \"The Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitaller\" is a story about Julian the Hospitaller, a man who shares some similarities with Oedipus; \"A Simple Soul\" tells the story of a servant girl named Felicite; and lastly \"Herodias\" retells the beheading of St. John the Baptist."],"year":2019,"genres":["fiction","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
