{"id":"alexandre-dumas--the-three-musketeers","title":"The Three Musketeers","titleAlpha":"three musketeers","author":"Alexandre Dumas","language":"en","description":"A young Gascon moves to Paris to join the King's Musketeers where he starts to investigate the kidnapping of his landlord's wife.","longDescription":["The Three Musketeers is the first of three adventure novels written by Alexandre Dumas featuring the character of d'Artagnan.","The young d'Artagnan leaves home in Gascony for Paris to join the King's Musketeers. On his way to Paris, the letter which will introduce him to the commander of the Musketeers is stolen by a mysterious man in the town of Meung. This \"Man of Meung\" turns out to be a confidant of the infamous Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of the government of France.","When he arrives in Paris and seeks an audience with the commander of the Musketeers, d'Artagnan sees this man again and rushes to confront him. As he pushes his way out he provokes three inseparable musketeers - Athos, Porthos and Aramis - and ends up setting up duels with all three of them that afternoon. At the first of the duels he discovers, to his surprise, that each of the three is a second to the other. As they start to fight, they are ambushed by the Cardinal's men and join forces. So begins one of the most enduring partnerships in literature.","When d'Artagnan's landlord tells him that his wife has been kidnapped, d'Artagnan investigates, falls in love and becomes embroiled in a plot to destabilize France.","The Three Musketeers was first published in 1844 and has been adapted for stage, film, television, and animation many times; such is the endurance of its appeal. At its heart is a fast-paced tale of love and adventure."],"year":1844,"genres":["adventure","fiction","history"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
