It's among the most famous cycles of poetry in Latin literature. The Eclogues were written at a time of political and social upheaval in Rome, and they reflect Virgil's concerns about the state of the Roman Republic under Augustus's rule.","The poems are set in an idealized, rural landscape and feature shepherds engaging in conversations about love, politics, and the natural world. The characters and themes are often allegorical, representing contemporary political figures and events in a veiled manner. The poems also draw on the pastoral tradition established by earlier Greek poets like Theocritus.","The first eclogue introduces two shepherds, Tityrus and Meliboeus, who discuss the impact of recent land expropriations on their lives. Other eclogues explore themes such as unrequited love, the idyllic rural life, and the effects of political turmoil on the countryside."],"year":2023,"genres":["poetry"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
