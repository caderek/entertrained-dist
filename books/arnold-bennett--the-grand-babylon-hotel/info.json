As he's sucked in to the inner workings of the hotel and its staff he has to make a series of stark choices for the safety of his family and guests.","The Grand Babylon Hotel proceeds at a pace that betrays the novel's roots: it was originally serialized in 1901 in the Golden Penny. It was Arnold Bennett's second novel, and was followed by at least forty works of fiction along with numerous plays and non-fiction works. Since its original publication The Grand Babylon Hotel has remained in print, and it has also been adapted for film and radio."],"year":1902,"genres":["classics","fiction"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
