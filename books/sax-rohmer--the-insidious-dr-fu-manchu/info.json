  "longDescription": [
    "The Insidious Dr. Fu-Manchu, first published in the UK as The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu, is the first novel to introduce the inimitable Fu-Manchu, famous not just for his moustache, but for being a nigh-unstoppable criminal mastermind and part of the \"Yellow Peril.\" This novel is a collection of previously-published short stories, slightly re-written by Rohmer to form a cohesive whole.",
    "The narrator, Dr. Petrie, is a sort of Watson to Nayland Smith's Holmes; but Smith resembles more of a James Bond than a Sherlock Holmes as the two barrel through action scenes and near-death scenarios planned by Fu-Manchu, a master scientist, chemist, and poisoner.",
    "This novel was one of the first to popularize the trope of the \"mysterious Chinaman,\" an element that later became so clich√©d that Ronald Knox, the famous detective story writer, declared that \"no Chinaman must figure\" in good detective stories.",
    "The casual racism evident in the characters and events is a symptom of the xenophobic climate in the UK at the time, which was precipitated by many things - the Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, Chinese immigration, and other fears. Despite that racism, the plot remains fast-paced and engaging, and is lent a modern air by Fu-Manchu's role as an early prototype for a Bond supervillain."
