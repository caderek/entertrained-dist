Kipling spent both his early years and his late teenage years in India, and that upbringing is front and center in these stories - despite them being written while he was living in Vermont, in the United States.","The stories are fable-like, with most of them centering on the lives of anthropomorphised jungle animals and a few focused on human characters in India. The stories were popular from the start, and have since been adapted in countless ways in print, screen, and other media."],"year":2016,"genres":["adventure","children","fiction","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
