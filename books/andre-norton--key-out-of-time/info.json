Yet, the world it described was nowhere in sight. Surrounded on all sides by shallow seas and archipelagos instead of the major landmasses they had expected to find, the Terrans must now try to reconcile the planet's past with its present. What could have transformed the planet so dramatically and what happened to the intelligent beings who had once colonized the planet? The key to this mystery lies somewhere in time."],"year":1963,"genres":["fiction","science-fiction","travel"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
