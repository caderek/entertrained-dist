As the diary unfolds, we learn more about Lorelei's past and her cynical, rather mercenary approach towards romance, all set in a light, funny, and very charming atmosphere.","Originally published as a series of sketches known as \"the Lorelei stories\" in Harper's Bazaar, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was published as a novel in 1925. Despite lukewarm initial reviews, it quickly became a success, becoming the second-best seller of 1926. Since then it has gone on to be an international bestseller, having been printed in over eighty-five editions and adapted several times - most famously as the 1953 film starring Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell. Edith Wharton called it \"the great American novel,\" and it has garnered praise from many authors including James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald."],"year":2022,"genres":["comedy","fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
