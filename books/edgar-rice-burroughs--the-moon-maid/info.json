The hero and his companion have a series of adventures there, and discover both the sophisticated Va-gas and the malevolent Kalkars. Time passes, and we turn to following the hero's descendants as they fight against an invasion of the Earth by the Kalkars. In these episodes, the American flag has become a holy totem, uniting the human rebels.","The Moon Maid was published in Argosy magazine between 1923 and 1925 as a series of three short novels, which were eventually combined into a single book edition in 1926. It was well-received by readers, and a number of critics consider it to be Burroughs' best work of science fiction. Today it's not as well-known as his Barsoom or Tarzan novels."],"year":1923,"genres":["fiction","science-fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
