{"id":"james-branch-cabell--chivalry","title":"Chivalry","titleAlpha":"chivalry","author":"James Branch Cabell","language":"en","description":"A collection of loosely connected stories of courtly love in medieval France and England.","longDescription":["Chivalry, a collection of romantic tales written by the supposed medieval poet Nicolas of Caen, is the fifth installment in James Branch Cabell's Biography of the Life of Manuel. The stories take place in medieval France and England, and involve royal figures from history. The theme of courtly love, where a knight preserves honor and stays true to his mistress, is common thread throughout. Characters take on the role of troubadour, singing of their love and devotion.","The subtitle \"Dizain des Reines\" refers to a type of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century French poetry featuring ten-line stanzas. Here, it corresponds to the ten stories and their respective queens.","Chivalry was written in 1909. Later, Cabell developed the idea of arranging some of his works into a biographical series that traces the life and legacy of the fictional Dom Manuel. He revised Chivalry in 1921 to work Manuel into the storyline and connect it to his other works."],"year":null,"genres":["classics","fantasy","fiction","history"],"topics":["medieval"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
