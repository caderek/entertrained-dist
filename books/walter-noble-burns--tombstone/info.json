Wyatt Earp (the \"Lion of Tombstone\"), his brothers Virgil and Morgan, and their friend Doc Holliday face off against rustlers and outlaws like Curly Bill, Billy and Ike Clanton, Frank and Tom McLaury, and Johnny Ringo, culminating in the famous gunfight at the O. K. Corral.","Throughout the narrative, Burns draws the reader into the life of the boomtown, from founding, to meteoric rise, and final collapse, with a focus on the personalities, conflicts, and myths that have cemented the town and its characters as a fixture in many aspects of American popular culture, including books, comics, radio dramas, films, and television. Burns' Tombstone is the iconic frontier town of \"The Old West.\""],"year":2023,"genres":["biography","fiction","history"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
