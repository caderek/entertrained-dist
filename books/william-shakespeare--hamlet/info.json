  "longDescription": [
    "Not only was Hamlet one of William Shakespeare's most popular works during his lifetime, it is also considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature. \"To be, or not to be,\" a line from one of Hamlet's soliloquies, is one of the most widely known quotes in modern English and has been referenced in countless works of literature, theater, film, and music.",
    "During a dark winter night Horatio and a pair of watchmen encounter a ghost that resembles the late King of Denmark, the father of Prince Hamlet. After failing to converse with the ghost, Hamlet is brought to the site of the encounter. The ghost tells the story of his death. He was murdered by King Claudius, the dead king's brother and Hamlet's new stepfather. Hamlet swears to avenge him and kill Claudius.",
    "This Standard Ebooks edition is based on William George Clark and William Aldis Wright's 1887 Victoria edition, which is taken from the Globe edition."
