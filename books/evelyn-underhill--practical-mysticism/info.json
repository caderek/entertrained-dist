Evelyn Underhill doesn't use much Christian terminology, instead preferring to use words that may be considered \"new age.\" If one can get past the terminology, the \"Practical Mysticism\" allows anyone to explore the mystical aspects of their own worldview without necessarily betraying their prior deeply-held beliefs.","Practical Mysticism is not a guidebook for mystical practice, though it does provide some tips along the way. What it does give is an introduction and apology for the sufficiently motivated; those that see (or want to see) the world in a different way."],"year":1914,"genres":["classics","nonfiction","spirituality"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
