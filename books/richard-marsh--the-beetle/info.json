{"id":"richard-marsh--the-beetle","title":"The Beetle","titleAlpha":"beetle","author":"Richard Marsh","language":"en","description":"A group of middle-class Victorians find themselves pitted against an ancient Egyptian evil.","longDescription":["The Beetle was published in 1897, the same year as Dracula - and outsold it six to one that year. Like Dracula, the novel is steeped in the evil mysteries of an ancient horror: in this case, a mysterious ancient Egyptian creature bent on revenge.","The story is told through the sequential points of view of a group of middle-class Victorians who find themselves enmeshed in the creature's plot. The creature, in the guise of an Egyptian man, appears in London seeking revenge against a popular member of Parliament. They soon find out that it can shape shift into other things, including women; that it can control minds and use hypnosis; and that it won't stop at anything to get the revenge it seeks. The heroes are soon caught in a whirlwind of chase scenes, underground laboratories, secret cults, and more as they race to foil the creature.","While The Beetle didn't earn the lasting popularity of Stoker's counterpart, it remains a strange and unique morsel of Victorian sensationalist fiction."],"year":2020,"genres":["fiction","horror","revenge"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
