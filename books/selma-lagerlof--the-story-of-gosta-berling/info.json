Joining the other saved souls in the pensioners' wing of the mansion, he embarks upon a series of larger-than-life stories that tell of adventure, revelry, romance and sadness.","Gosta Berling was the eventual Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlof's first published novel, and was written as an entry to a magazine competition. The richly detailed landscapes of Varmland were drawn from her own upbringing there, and the local folk tales inspired many of the individual stories in the book. The novel was published in Swedish in 1891; this edition is based on the 1898 English translation by Pauline Bancroft Flach. In 1924 the story was made into a silent film, launching the career of Greta Garbo."],"year":2018,"genres":["fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
