  "longDescription": [
    "Father Brown is a Catholic priest, but a slightly unusual one in that he's also an amateur detective. Unlike his more famous literary cousin Sherlock, Father Brown takes a less analytical and more intuition-oriented approach to solving the many murders that he happens to come across.",
    "This collection of short murder mysteries is Brown's first appearance on the literary stage. In it we see him practicing his unique brand of sleuthing alongside his sometimes-partner, the reformed master criminal Flambeau."
