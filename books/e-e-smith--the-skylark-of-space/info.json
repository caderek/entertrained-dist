Dr. Seaton accidentally discovers a source of energy which could be used to travel to other star systems, but when he tries to show others, it fails to work. Most of his colleagues ridicule him, and he quits his career to focus on trying to refine the process. Meanwhile Dr. DuQuesne realizes the truth, and is willing to do anything to have that power.","Both scientists refine the process well enough to build a spaceship and visit other planets, but who will these new civilizations side with?","This version of The Skylark of Space was originally published in three parts during 1928 Amazing Stories. The novelization, which was published later, differs significantly."],"year":1928,"genres":["classics","fiction","science-fiction"],"topics":["space"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
