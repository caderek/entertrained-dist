{"id":"emile-gaboriau--the-lerouge-case","title":"The Lerouge Case","titleAlpha":"lerouge case","author":"Ã‰mile Gaboriau","language":"en","description":"A widow is found dead under mysterious circumstances, and Monsieur Lecoq of the police arranges to have his mentor brought in to help solve the crime.","longDescription":["Considered by many to be the first detective novel, The Lerouge Case (aka The Widow Lerouge) introduces Monsieur Lecoq (later Inspector Lecoq), a former \"habitual criminal\" who becomes a police officer. Emile Gaboriau based Lecoq at least in part on an actual criminal-turned-police-officer, Eugene Vidocq, who went on to be the first director of the Surete. In this first book, Lecoq plays a relatively small part, the bulk of the mystery solving being done by Lecoq's mentor Tabaret, an amateur detective.","Gaboriau thus introduces both a police detective and an amateur detective at the same time. Many of the attributes now taken for granted in the mystery arena originated with Gaboriau and Lecoq - hyper attention to detail, mastery of disguises, amateur \"agents\" who assist the detective, and the above-mentioned amateur detectives that assist and sometimes out-perform the police versions.","Gaboriau's Lecoq novels were wildly successful until another amateur detective named Holmes made his appearance. Holmes even comments on Lecoq in A Study in Scarlet, dismissing him as a \"miserable bungler\" in response to Dr. Watson's question. Nevertheless, Arthur Conan Doyle was obviously influenced by Gaboriau and Lecoq, as many of Holmes' traits can be seen first in Lecoq."],"year":1866,"genres":["fiction","mystery"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
