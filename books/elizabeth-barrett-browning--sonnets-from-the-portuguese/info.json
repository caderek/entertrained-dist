Despite what the title suggests, Browning in fact composed the sonnets in English. She decided to frame them as \"translations\" because she was concerned they may have been too personal to publish. Fortunately her husband, Robert Browning, convinced her to publish them, and they went on to become some of the most famous and critically-acclaimed love sonnets to this day."],"year":2017,"genres":["poetry","romance"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
