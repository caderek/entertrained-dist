{"id":"edgar-allan-poe--short-fiction","title":"Short Fiction","titleAlpha":"short fiction","author":"Edgar Allan Poe","language":"en","description":"A collection of Edgar Allan Poe's short fiction, ordered by date of publication.","longDescription":["Edgar Allan Poe is one of the primary figures of American nineteenth-century literature. His writing was heavily influenced by Romanticism ideals of emotion and feeling, and although mostly known for his Gothic-tinged horror, his tales jump between many different genres, including science-fiction, satire, humor, mystery, and even early detective fiction.","Poe mostly wrote short stories and poems, published in magazines and periodicals like the Southern Literary Messenger and Graham's Magazine, although he also turned his hand to essays and novels (including The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket). He was one of the first American writers to pursue writing as a career, but was better received in France than in his native country. He struggled to make ends meet and resorted to work as a literary critic. His reputation suffered a further blow after his unfortunately early death in 1849 at the age of 40, when a rival not only wrote an extremely unflattering obituary, but bought the rights to his work and published a compilation with a hit piece for an introduction. This undeserved reputation took many decades to fade, but didn't hinder praise from other notable authors including Arthur Conan Doyle and H. P. Lovecraft.","Collected here are all of Poe's short fiction stories, in order of their original magazine publication. Notable stories include \"The Gold-Bug,\" \"The Black Cat,\" \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" and many more."],"year":2020,"genres":["adventure","comedy","fantasy","fiction","horror","mystery","satire","science-fiction","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
