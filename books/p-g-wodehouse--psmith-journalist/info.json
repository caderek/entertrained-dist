{"id":"p-g-wodehouse--psmith-journalist","title":"Psmith, Journalist","titleAlpha":"psmith, journalist","author":"P. G. Wodehouse","language":"en","description":"Psmith, visiting New York with Mike on a cricket tour, finds entertainment and trouble for himself in the newspaper business, stirring up trouble with New York's notorious gangs.","longDescription":["Growing bored while accompanying his Cambridge chum Mike on a cricket tour of the United States, Psmith seeks adventure in New York City. He finds it in the form of the weekly newspaper Cosy Moments, a completely bland and inoffensive publication at which, through charm and sheer force of personality, Psmith appoints himself an unpaid subeditor, fires the entire contributing staff, and embarks on a crusade against the slumlords, gangs, and boxing managers of his holiday destination.","Psmith, Journalist is the third of Wodehouse's Psmith novels, and is a marked departure from the author's usual settings and themes. It presents a very strong social justice theme with direct, harsh condemnation of exploitation, corruption, racism, and inequality in early-twentieth century America, and its themes continue to resonate with readers a century later.","The story first appeared in The Captain magazine from October 1909 to February 1910, and was first published as a book, including eight illustrations, by A & C Black in 1915.
