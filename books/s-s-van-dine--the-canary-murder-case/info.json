{"id":"s-s-van-dine--the-canary-murder-case","title":"The Canary Murder Case","titleAlpha":"canary murder case","author":"S. S. Van Dine","language":"en","description":"A Manhattan art connoisseur turned amateur detective gets involved in a murder investigation when a theatrical starlet is found dead in her apartment.","longDescription":["Philo Vance, the snobbish art collector who happens to be the longtime friend of District Attorney John Markham, once more finds himself drawn into a criminal investigation. Margaret Odell, the beautiful and talented theatrical singer nicknamed \"The Canary,\" has been strangled during the night, and from the very beginning there are signs that nothing in the case is quite what it appears to be. Accompanied once more by Sergeant Heath, the unlikely trio struggle to make sense of the evidence.","S. S. Van Dine found even more success with this novel, his sophomore outing as a mystery writer. Spending months on the bestseller lists, it was also the first of his books to be made into a movie, with William Powell starring as Philo Vance. At a time when a majority of successful mystery writers were English, Van Dine's novels evoked an atmosphere that was distinctly American, with Vance's cultured perspective colliding with Markham's pragmatic sensibilities and Heath's no-nonsense street smarts."],"year":null,"genres":["classics","fiction","mystery"],"topics":["detective"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
