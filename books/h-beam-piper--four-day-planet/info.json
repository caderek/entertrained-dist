Beam Piper","language":"en","description":"A young reporter gets caught up in intrigue and adventure chasing tallow-wax bounties with the monster hunters on Fenris, a planet with a two-thousand-hour day and four-day year.","longDescription":["Reminiscent of old whaling stories, Four-Day Planet follows the story of Walter Boyd, a scrappy 17-year-old reporter working for his father at the Port Sandor Times. Walt gets tied up in the adventures of the sea-monster hunters on Fenris - a barely-habitable planet with a 2,000-hour day. The prized - and only - commodity on Fenris is tallow-wax, a miraculous material harvested from the dangerous seas of the planet.","While being set in a grand sci-fi universe, the book packs in more about intrigue, betrayal, and the grit required to survive on a backwater planet of the Federation. The book was later re-published as a \"two-for-one\" with Lone Star Planet (originally titled A Planet for Texans)."],"year":1961,"genres":["classics","fiction","science-fiction"],"topics":["space"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
