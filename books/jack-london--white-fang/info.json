In The Call of the Wild we follow a dog's journey from domestication to wilderness, but in White Fang we see the opposite: a wild wolf-dog captured by men and eventually domesticated.","White Fang's journey isn't an easy one; both the wild and civilization have their share of brutal violence. But he eventually seems happy in a home with a loving family.
