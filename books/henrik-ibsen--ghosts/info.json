{"id":"henrik-ibsen--ghosts","title":"Ghosts","titleAlpha":"ghosts","author":"Henrik Ibsen","language":"en","description":"A Norwegian sea captain's widow who, no matter how much she tries, cannot escape the ghosts of the past.","longDescription":["Written in 1881, when melodrama and farce were still at their peak of popularity, Ibsen's Ghosts is a three-act tragedy that explores uncomfortable, even forbidden themes. It is also a highly critical commentary on the morality of the day. The play centers around the widow of a prominent Norwegian sea captain whose son returns home and, with tragic consequences, revives the ghosts of the past that she has long labored to put to rest.","Ghosts immediately became a source of controversy for its inclusion of topics like venereal disease, incest, and euthanasia, and it was banned from being performed in England for many years. Its arrival signals a shift in the nature of theatre and, despite negative criticism, it was translated into other languages and performed in Sweden, Germany, and New York within a few years of its debut. It stands now as one of the works considered to have ushered in the era of modern drama."],"year":2019,"genres":["drama"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
