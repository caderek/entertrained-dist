{"id":"robert-e-howard--short-fiction","title":"Short Fiction","titleAlpha":"short fiction","author":"Robert E. Howard","language":"en","description":"A collection of Robert E. Howard's short stories, including the barbarian adventures of Conan the Cimmerian.","longDescription":["Conan, the Cimmerian barbarian, romps across the pages of Robert E. Howard's Hyborian adventures, slicing down enemy after enemy and trying not to fall too hard for a succession of ladies in need of rescue. Although very much a product of the pulp fantasy magazines of the 1930s, Conan has surpassed his contemporaries to become the quintessential barbarian of the fantasy genre: the muscle-bound and instinct-led hero, always willing to fight his way out of any fix.","Collected here are Howard's public domain short stories, including ten Conan short stories and the history of Hyboria that Howard wrote as a guide for himself to write from. Gods of the North originally was a Conan story, but after being rejected by the first publisher was rewritten slightly to a character called Amra; it was later republished as The Frost-Giant's Daughter with the name changed back. The stories were serialised (with a couple of exceptions) in Weird Tales magazine between 1925 and 1936, and have gone on to spawn multiple licensed and unlicensed sequels, comics, films and games."],"year":null,"genres":["classics","fantasy","fiction","shorts"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
