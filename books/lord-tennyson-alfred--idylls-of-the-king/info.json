While some of them are stories of adventure and daring of the kind you'd expect from an Arthurian epic, many take on a darker tone, relating how Arthur was betrayed and how his kingdom grew decadent and eventually fell.","The poems stand on their own as carefully-constructed and masterful examples of long-form blank-verse poetry, and they're engaging to read strictly as tales of knighthood and intrigue - but many also read the Idylls as allegorical references to Victorian societal mores."],"year":1885,"genres":["classics","poetry","romance"],"topics":["knights"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
