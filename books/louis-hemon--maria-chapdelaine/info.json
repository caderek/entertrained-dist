It was his only work published in his lifetime, as he died in a tragic train accident before learning of its success.","The novel is described as a masterwork that was Canada's entry into world literature and Quebec's introduction to the rest of the Francophone world. An enduring work, it has served as the basis of four movies, and has been adapted into plays, an illustrated novel, a radio novel, a television series, and an opera."],"year":2022,"genres":["fiction","romance"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
