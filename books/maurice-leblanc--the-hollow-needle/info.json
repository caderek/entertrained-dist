{"id":"maurice-leblanc--the-hollow-needle","title":"The Hollow Needle","titleAlpha":"hollow needle","author":"Maurice Leblanc","language":"en","description":"The famous gentleman-thief plans his most audacious crime yet: to steal the lost treasures of France.","longDescription":["In this first full-length Arsene Lupin novel the gentleman-thief remains a shadowy figure for most of the novel, working two steps beyond the law with a hidden aim. To fight against this anti-hero, Leblanc introduces Isidore Beautrelet, the prodigious school-boy detective. Also making an appearance are old foes Detective Ganimard and (in yet another copyright-defeating name change) Holmlock Shears. The battle of wills that ensues pulls Isidore through rural France as he tries to get to the bottom of Lupin's motives.","The Hollow Needle was originally serialized in the magazine Je Sais Tout from 1908 to 1909, and was translated into English in 1910. Arsene Lupin starred in many further stories and plays, and a direct sequel to this story, Le second visage d'Arsene Lupin, was written by Pierre Boileau and Pierre Ayraud in 1975."],"year":1909,"genres":["classics","fiction"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
