  "longDescription": [
    "Mr. J. G. Reeder, mild-mannered, slightly shabby, and a throw-back with his mutton-chops and silk hat, is often mistaken for an office clerk. But his superiors have recognized his special gift: Reeder has a criminal mind. As an employee of the Department of Public Prosecutions, he's frequently called upon to exercise his unusual talent to solve crimes that have confounded the local police.",
    "In this collection of eight stories, Mr. Reeder solves robberies, burglaries, and murders, often at great risk to his personal health and well-being, and frequently employing his great insight into human nature and the criminal mind.",
    "Published under the title The Murder Book of Mr. J. G. Reeder in the United States, these stories were adapted for British television between 1969 and 1971 and also for BBC Radio in 2007."
