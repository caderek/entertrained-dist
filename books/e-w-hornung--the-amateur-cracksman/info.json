Raffles and his friend \"Bunny\" Manders are the quintessential rich young socialites; but behind the high-living facade, they've exhausted their funds. There's only one way to pay the bills: a secret double-life as criminals.","Raffles was E. W. Hornung's biggest literary success, with the Raffles stories proving perennially popular. This volume was dedicated to his brother-in-law Arthur Conan Doyle, and in Raffles and Manders there is a clear relation to Holmes and Watson. The character's popularity helped kickstart the \"gentleman thief\" genre, and it's easy to see parallels to the later stories of Arsene Lupin by Maurice Leblanc."],"year":1899,"genres":["crime","fiction","mystery","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
