When Tom Canty, a young pauper in London, meets Prince Edward, the two switch clothes and assume the other's identity. Tom then learns the life of royalty, while the true prince discovers the troubles of commoners.","As usual, Twain delivers both humor and social commentary in abundance. Although aimed at children, Pauper provides moral and social criticism of topics like the justice system and inequality, and deals with themes which appeal to readers of all ages."],"year":2018,"genres":["children","fiction","history"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
