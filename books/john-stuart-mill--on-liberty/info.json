In it, he applies his views on the Utilitarian ethical theory to systems of society and governance. The result became one of the most influential essays on liberal political thought in modern history.","In On Liberty Mill addresses such familiar concepts as freedom of speech, the importance of individuality, and the limits of society's influence on the individual. He caps the discussion with an application of these principles to problems of the day, including education and the economy."],"year":1859,"genres":["classics","philosophy"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
