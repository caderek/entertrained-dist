Chesterton","language":"en","description":"The fourth set of stories of a Catholic priest who is also an amateur detective.","longDescription":["Father Brown returns in his fourth collection of stories, and his sidekick Flambeau makes a return as well, although only in the two framing stories at the beginning and end of the collection.","In the intervening ten stories, Father Brown is alone, and investigating mysteries involving objects as varied as mirrors, literal goldfish (made out of gold), and a suit of armor. As always, his investigations also provide him an opportunity to expound on the nature of evil, the differences between a charlatan's representation of the supernatural and the real thing, and the opportunities for thieves and murderers to repent of their deeds."],"year":1927,"genres":["fiction","mystery","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
