First published in 1854, Walden is an account of Thoreau's famous experiment in solitude: spending over two years alone in a cabin near the wilderness.","Walden is broken into sections that meditate on single themes: economy, reading, sounds, solitude, visitors, and so on. The style is complex, weaving back and forth between simple, home-spun prose and complex allegory, metaphor, and allusion. This makes Walden an interesting read because while it may seem accessible on the surface, it's a book that requires deep and repeated reading to fully appreciate its many complexities."],"year":2014,"genres":["biography","history","nonfiction","philosophy"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
