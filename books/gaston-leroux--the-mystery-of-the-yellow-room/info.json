Joseph Rouletabille, a bright young reporter, is drawn to investigate the mystery, trying to understand what really happened (and how!) before another attempt on her life is made.","The Mystery of the Yellow Room is an early \"locked-room mystery\" novel, and helped define it as a genre. Agatha Christie, in her novel The Clocks, had her fictional detective Hercule Poirot describe it as a masterpiece. John Dickson Carr, frequently cited as the best mystery writer specializing in locked-room mysteries, named it as his own personal favorite example of the genre."],"year":1907,"genres":["classics","fiction","mystery"],"topics":["detective"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
