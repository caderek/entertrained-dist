He masks his shortcomings, and those of his staff and students, with bluster and bravado.

The book was critically acclaimed upon its release and hailed by the New Statesman as \"like nothing else in the world\" and \"a work of genius.\""],"year":2024,"genres":["fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
