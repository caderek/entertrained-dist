  "longDescription": [
    "Anne Elliot is the under-valued daughter of a vain and improvident English baronet, Sir Walter Elliot. Some years previously, at the urging of a family friend, Anne had rejected a marriage proposal from a young but impoverished naval captain. When she unexpectedly encounters him again, she is filled with regrets.",
    "Persuasion was published in 1817, six months after Jane Austen's death, and is the last novel she completed in full. It was well-regarded on publication and has been turned into several television series and movies."
