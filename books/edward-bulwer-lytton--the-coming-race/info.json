{"id":"edward-bulwer-lytton--the-coming-race","title":"The Coming Race","titleAlpha":"coming race","author":"Edward Bulwer-Lytton","language":"en","description":"While exploring a mine, a man falls through a chasm into an underground world populated by a mysterious race.","longDescription":["An engineer encounters a strange sight while exploring a mine, and reluctantly reports it to the narrator. The two descend into the mine together, but an accident causes the narrator to fall through a crevice and into a secret subterranean world. The inhabitants seem to be an offshoot of an ancient human race who have been living and evolving underground. They have command over a fluid called vril, which gives them both great destructive and great creative and healing powers. Because of their ability to destroy so easily, their society has developed into a very peaceful, utopian one. They don't eat or kill animals, and only take life that is a threat to their community.","These people call themselves the Vril-ya, and consider themselves to have a superior form of government that has developed over many ages. While our narrator considers his native United States a great society that all should be proud of, the Vril-ya dismiss it as Koom-Posh (their word for \"democracy\"), which in their view is government by the ignorant, and destined to collapse into chaos. The above-ground world, with its achievements based on rivalry and conflict, is in contrast to the world of the Vril-ya, where personal achievement and honors are not pursued.","The narrator spends some time exploring this society, but thinks about how, if ever, he will return home. But before he can return, he unwittingly becomes the object of romantic interest - putting his life in peril.","The Coming Race was published anonymously in 1871, and is considered one of the earliest works of science fiction."],"year":1871,"genres":["classics","fiction","science-fiction"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
