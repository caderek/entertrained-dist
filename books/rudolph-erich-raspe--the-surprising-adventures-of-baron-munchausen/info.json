These very short tales were originally intended as contemporary satire, but their outrageous silliness is still entertaining today."],"year":2014,"genres":["comedy","fantasy","fiction","satire"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
