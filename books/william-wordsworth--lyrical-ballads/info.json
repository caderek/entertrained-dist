A hugely influential work, Lyrical Ballads is generally acknowledged to have started the Romantic movement in English literature - a period marked by a departure from the stiff and unapproachable poetry of earlier times, and by a focus on readable, relatable verse written in everyday language. Many of Wordsworth's poems focus on the natural world and the down-to-earth people of the country, another far departure from the rational and dry literature of old. Romanticism was one of the largest sea changes in modern English literature, and Lyrical Ballads was its catalyst.","This ebook edition is based on the 1805 edition of Lyrical Ballads, and features the famous poems The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, \"Tintern Abbey,\" \"Expostulation and Reply,\" \"Lucy Gray,\" and many others."],"year":1798,"genres":["classics","poetry"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
