Raffles short stories.","longDescription":["After the events of The Amateur Cracksman A. J. Raffles is missing, presumed dead, and \"Bunny\" Manders is destitute but free after a stretch in prison for his crimes. So when a mysterious telegraph arrives suggesting the possibility of a lucrative position, Bunny has little option but to attend the given address.","Raffles was a commercial success for E. W. Hornung, garnering critical praise but also warnings about the glorification of crime. The Black Mask, published two years after his first collection of Raffles stories, takes a markedly more downcast tone, with the high-life escapades of the earlier stories curtailed by Raffles' purported death."],"year":1899,"genres":["classics","crime","fiction","mystery","shorts"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
