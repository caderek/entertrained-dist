They contend with monsters, mystery, and the ruins of an earlier age - but their quest is not what it seems.","The Jewels of Aptor is Samuel R. Delany's first published novel, written when he was a teenager. In it we see many of the concerns that occupied him in later work: language, poetry, myth, perception, and tensions between worldviews, wrapped in gorgeously poetic prose."],"year":1962,"genres":["classics","fiction","science-fiction"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
