  "longDescription": [
    "Bambi follows the life of the eponymous roe deer, from birth to maturity. Through the years Bambi meets friends, learns how to survive in the forest, finds love, and learns how to survive \"He\" - the name animals give to man. The novel gives a glimpse into forest life: dangerous, yet awe-inspiring; unforgiving, yet beautiful.",
    "Written by Felix Salten and published in 1923 in German, it was translated to English in 1928 by Whittaker Chambers. It is considered one of the first environmental novels, and in 1936 was banned by Nazi Germany for being a parable of the persecution of Jews in Europe.",
    "Although adapted into multiple movies, ballets, and plays, Bambi is perhaps most popularly remembered as the subject of Walt Disney's famous animated feature of the same name."
