  "longDescription": [
    "Eleven year-old Pollyanna, having recently been orphaned by her widower father, is sent back East to be cared for by her dutiful and stoic Vermont aunt. Naive and ever-literal, this very positive young girl brings with her an infectious habit of instinctive gratitude that was taught to her as \"the game\" by her late father. This game serves her well, while also uplifting the turn of the century New England community which becomes her home.",
    "Pollyanna inspired the production of five feature length films and fifteen subsequent novels, including books written by six other authors. Pollyanna was a best-selling children's book when first published, and the eponyms \"Pollyanna\" and \"Pollyanna Principle\" have taken a lasting place in our culture."
