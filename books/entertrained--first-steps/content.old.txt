Welcome, dear reader and soon-to-be typing maestro, to Entertrained! This is not just a website, but a journey where you'll learn, practice, and master touch typing while diving into the world of famous novels.
It's not just about training, it's about being entertained while you enter the realm of words!

001
In this chapter, we introduce you to the core of Entertrained - the Typing mode. Choose a book and start typing, one paragraph at a time. Your progress is saved after each completed paragraph.
Made a mistake? No worries! Press Ctrl+Backspace to delete a whole word or Tab to reset the current paragraph. Want to type foreign characters? Just press any key. Try it out with the word "naïve" or say hello in Chinese with "你好".
Need a moment of peace? Click the icon in the bottom left corner to enter Zen mode and hide all metrics and interface during typing. And don't worry about the timer, it pauses after each paragraph or if you're not typing for 5 seconds.
Remember, while speed is important, accuracy is key. As the saying goes, "Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast." So, take your time, aim for high accuracy, and watch your typing skills soar. Enjoy the journey of words!

002
Tired of typing but still want to follow the engaging story? Switch to Reading mode. Mark each paragraph as read by clicking it or pressing Enter. These paragraphs count towards the overall progress of the book.
You can toggle between Typing and Reading mode at any time, but remember, switching in the middle of a paragraph will reset that paragraph's progress.

003
Entertrained is not just about typing and reading, it's about making the experience truly yours. Customize the look of your typing prompt and reading screen separately to your liking. Choose your fonts, sizes, spaces, text formatting, and more.
You can even customize your screen keyboard, recommendations, themes, and sounds.

004
Now that you're familiar with all the features of Entertrained, it's time to embark on your journey. Remember, it's not just about speed, but also about accuracy, persistence, and most importantly, having fun!
So, get ready, set, and start typing! Good luck, and remember, every word you type brings you one step closer to mastery!
