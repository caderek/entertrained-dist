She has grown into a beautiful young woman with a bright future; but her marriage, and her husband's secret, will lead her down a dark path.","Today, Irish writer J. Sheridan Le Fanu is remembered of as an early master of horror. In his own day, he would have thought of his work as falling into different genres, with his well-loved ghost stories, like \"Green Tea,\" in one genre, and his \"sensation novels,\" like Uncle Silas, in another.","In The Wyvern Mystery, the suspense is created not by the Gothic or the macabre, but by the all-too-prosaic secret held by Alice's husband, and how it grows to threaten both their futures."],"year":null,"genres":["classics","fiction","gothic","mystery","psychological"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
