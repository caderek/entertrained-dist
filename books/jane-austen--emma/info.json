{"id":"jane-austen--emma","title":"Emma","titleAlpha":"emma","author":"Jane Austen","language":"en","description":"A wealthy young woman decides to take on the role of patroness and matchmaker to a young protege, with considerably less than successful results.","longDescription":["Emma is one of Jane Austen's best-loved novels. Its eponymous heroine, Emma Woodhouse, has lived a pampered, protected life and consequently is somewhat unrealistic when she sets her sights on becoming a matchmaker for a young friend.","The novel provides a light-hearted insight into the distinctions of the rigid class structure of England in the Regency period, and the social barriers to marriage between persons considered to be of superior and inferior rank.","Emma was published in 1815, the last of Austen's novels to be published while she still lived. It received a generally very positive reception, and was well reviewed (though anonymously) by Sir Walter Scott. Criticisms of the novel, such as they were, centered around its supposed lack of plot, though its treatment of character was recognized and applauded. Today it is regarded as one of Austen's best works. The novel has been adapted many times for theater, movies and television."],"year":2018,"genres":["comedy","coming-of-age","fiction","friendship","romance"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
