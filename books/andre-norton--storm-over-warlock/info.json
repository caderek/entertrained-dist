Two Terrans who survive the enemy attack must go on the run, weaponless and with only a pair of wolverines as their companions. These survivors are driven to an unknown destination by dreams so powerful that they may be visions; but as they get closer to their goal, crossing brutal landscapes, tumultuous seas, and fog-filled caverns, the two find themselves losing control over their actions and unsure of what is real in this strange and hostile world."],"year":1960,"genres":["fiction","science-fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
