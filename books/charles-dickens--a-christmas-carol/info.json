The publishers had to produce two further editions between Christmas and the new year to meet the demand, and the novella has never been out of print.","A Christmas Carol tells the story of a greedy money-lender, Ebenezer Scrooge, who is first visited by the ghost of his former business partner and then by three spirits - the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. They show Scrooge's lack of compassion to him, compelling him to act more compassionately in the future and to honor Christmas in his heart."],"year":2018,"genres":["children","fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
