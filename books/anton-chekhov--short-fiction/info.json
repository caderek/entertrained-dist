A physician by day, he's famously quoted as saying, \"Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my mistress.\" Chekhov wrote nearly 300 short stories in his long writing career; while at first he wrote mainly to make a profit, as his interest in writing - and his skill - grew, he wrote stories that heavily influenced the modern development of the form.","His stories are famous for, among other things, their ambiguous morality and their often inconclusive nature. Chekhov was a firm believer that the role of the artist was to correctly pose a question, but not necessarily to answer it.","This collection contains all of his short stories and two novellas, all translated by Constance Garnett, and arranged by the date they were originally published."],"year":null,"genres":["classics","fiction","shorts"],"topics":[],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
