Motivated by the conviction that the subordination of women was \"one of the chief obstacles to human improvement,\" Mill argued not merely for women's suffrage, but for \"a principle of perfect equality\" - the complete social, political, and legal equality of the sexes.","Mill credited his late wife, Harriet Taylor Mill, with many of the important ideas put forth in the book."],"year":2021,"genres":["nonfiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
