{"id":"natsume-soseki--kusamakura","title":"Kusamakura","titleAlpha":"kusamakura","author":"Natsume S≈çseki","language":"en","description":"An artist and poet leaves the city to look for a new perspective on his work.","longDescription":["Walking along a mountain path towards a remote hot springs hotel, our unnamed protagonist muses on his theory of \"unhumanity\" and his hopes that it will break him out of his creative block. On arrival, the town itself has plenty of unhumanity on display, but while poems on those subjects spring easily to mind, painting still eludes him. Will the mysterious Nami-san, the daughter of the hotel owner, be the catalyst that unlocks that frustratingly out-of-reach art?","Natsume Soseki was already a household name in Japan after his previous novels I Am a Cat and Botchan, but it was the success of Kusamakura that allowed him to give up his role as a professor of English literature at Tokyo Imperial University to focus on writing. Kusamakura translates to English directly as \"grass pillow,\" which for the Japanese reader has a connotation of a poetic wandering; for this edition Takahashi Kazutomo added the subtitle \"Unhuman Tour\" to bring the same feeling to the translation."],"year":2024,"genres":["fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
