While many of his collections were illustrated, this particular one is different - the illustrations were completed first. Dunsany then used the illustrations as inspirations for the stories around them.","This collection features fourteen short stories, all of them whimsical, imaginative, and deeply strange. Dunsany writes stories that don't always have a happy ending, and these are no exception - though they're written in an almost fairytale or allegorical style, they each have a melancholy, vengeful, or even mad edge to them."],"year":2014,"genres":["fantasy","fiction","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
