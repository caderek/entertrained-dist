{"id":"leo-tolstoy--resurrection","title":"Resurrection","titleAlpha":"resurrection","author":"Leo Tolstoy","language":"en","description":"A Russian landlord makes reparations to the woman he wronged in his youth.","longDescription":["Resurrection, the last full-length novel written by Leo Tolstoy, was published in 1899 after ten years in the making. A humanitarian cause - the pacifist Doukhobor sect, persecuted by the Russian government, needed funds to emigrate to Canada - prompted Tolstoy to finish the novel and dedicate its ensuing revenues to alleviate their plight. Ultimately, Tolstoy's actions were credited with helping hundreds of Doukhobors emigrate to Canada.","The novel centers on the relationship between Nekhludoff, a Russian landlord, and Maslova, a prostitute whose life took a turn for the worse after Nekhludoff wronged her ten years prior to the novel's events. After Nekhludoff happens to sit in the jury for a trial in which Maslova is accused of poisoning a merchant, Nekhludoff begins to understand the harm he has inflicted upon Maslova - and the harm that the Russian state and society inflicts upon the poor and marginalized - as he embarks on a quest to alleviate Maslova's suffering.","Nekhludoff's process of spiritual awakening in Resurrection serves as a framing for many of the novel's religious and political themes, such as the hypocrisy of State Christianity and the injustice of the penal system, which were also the subject of Tolstoy's nonfiction treatise on Christian anarchism, The Kingdom of God Is Within You. The novel also explores the \"single tax\" economic theory propounded by the American economist Henry George, which drives a major subplot in the novel concerning the management of Nekhludoff's estates."],"year":2021,"genres":["fiction","murder"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
