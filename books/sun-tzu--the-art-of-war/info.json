Despite questions about the historicity of the author, the text has stood the test of time and remains widely read by strategists, politicians, and even business leaders today.","Though Dr. Lionel Giles was not the first to translate Sun Tzu into English, he was the first to do so in a systematic and scholarly manner. His translation was unequaled until the mid-20th century, and remains relevant today due to his copious notes."],"year":2020,"genres":["nonfiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
