{"id":"h-beam-piper--space-viking","title":"Space Viking","titleAlpha":"space viking","author":"H. Beam Piper","language":"en","description":"A tragic starfarer seeks revenge in this epic space opera.","longDescription":["Initially serialized in Analog magazine between 1962 and 1963, Space Viking takes place after the events of H. Beam Piper's earlier serialization, The Cosmic Computer. Space Viking is a classic space opera: what begins as an interstellar tale of revenge turns into a swashbuckling adventure yarn, and finally into a meditation on empire-building and galactic governance with direct allusions to our modern history.","This richness of content makes Space Viking a unique read. The reader begins by expecting a lighter sci-fi adventure, and early on the plot delivers; but as events transpire, the reader is deftly drawn away from action scenes and into a more nuanced discussion on governance and human nature."],"year":2016,"genres":["fiction","revenge","science-fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
