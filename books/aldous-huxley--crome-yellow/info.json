The younger guests of the manor grapple with navigating love and sex within a post-Victorian society. Older guests and inhabitants obsess over trivialities from their vast libraries, eager to give a show of their knowledge to each other. The novel uses these interactions to paint a scathing representation of their insecurities and world views.","Crome Yellow is Aldous Huxley's first published novel. His inspiration for many of the characters came from his time spent at Garsington Manor, a haven for many writers and poets of the time."],"year":2021,"genres":["comedy","fiction","satire"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
