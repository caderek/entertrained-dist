Unfortunately for the troupe, He has motives for joining that aren't immediately apparent; motives that start to threaten the integrity of the circus.","He Who Gets Slapped was first presented in Moscow in 1915 to enthusiastic audiences, although critics at the time were confused about Leonid Andreyev's subtexts.
