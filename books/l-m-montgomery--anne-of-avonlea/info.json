As she begins teaching at Avonlea school she is determined to treat the children as she wishes she had been treated, and has many theories as to how that should be accomplished. She also enters the grown-up world of Avonlea in typical Anne fashion by working to beautify the landscape, and helping to form the Avonlea Village Improvement Society. Old friends are joined by new ones, including an outspoken neighbor with a rude parrot and a young-at-heart spinster who proves to be a true kindred spirit.","Anne of Avonlea, originally published in 1909, is the sequel to Anne of Green Gables, and follows Anne Shirley through her next two years. While it has received less critical acclaim than its predecessor, it has enjoyed enduring popularity and has been adapted into television, movie, and theater."],"year":1909,"genres":["fiction"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
