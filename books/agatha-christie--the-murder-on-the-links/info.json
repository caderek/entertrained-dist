Poirot arrives to find the businessman already dead, his body lying facedown in an open grave on a golf course, a knife in his back - the victim of a mysterious murder. Over the coming days Poirot clashes wits with an arrogant Parisian detective, Giraud, while Hastings finds himself pining after a beautiful but shadowy American expatriate known to him only as \"Cinderella.\" Together, Poirot and Hastings unravel the intricate web of mystery and deceit behind the murder.","Christie based this mystery after a real-life French murder case, and it's believed that this is the first detective novel to use the phrase \"the scene of the crime.\""],"year":1923,"genres":["fiction","mystery"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
