Roundly criticised by contemporary reviewers for its colorful and literal language and even banned by several libraries, it sealed its historical importance in part by being one of the first novels to be written entirely in American vernacular.","While Huck Finn is, on its face, an adventure tale for younger readers, it's also a cutting satire and a nuanced examination of racism and morality. Hemingway called it \"the best book we've had.\""],"year":2015,"genres":["children","fiction","travel"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
