G. Wodehouse that feature the trials, tribulations and adventures of the denizens of the turn-of-the-century English boarding school.","First published in schoolboy magazines starting in 1901, the stories originally appeared in publications like The Captain and Public School Magazine. Some were also later collected into books. These stories, written more than a decade before he moved on to his more famous characters like Jeeves and Wooster, represent Wodehouse's first magazine sales and showcase his early career. While some of these stories are definitely of a moment, they're filled with delightful bits that would be instantly recognizable to students and teachers of any age. Indeed, the stories experienced a bit of a resurgence in the latter part of the 20th century, and remain a worthy part of Wodehouse's canon."],"year":1901,"genres":["comedy","fiction","shorts"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
