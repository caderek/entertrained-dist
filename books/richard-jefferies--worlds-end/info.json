He had not yet settled into the nature-focused style that would come to define his later works, and it was only incrementally more successful than his previous two novels. However, contemporary critics noted his improved plotting and the more believable motives of his characters.","The novel documents the rise of a great city, Stirmingham, the enormous wealth of its founder, and a plot to acquire the founder's estate by any means necessary. Caught up in the middle are Aymer and Violet, two young lovers engaged to be married."],"year":2024,"genres":["fiction","murder"],"rights":"The source text and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the United States public domain; that is, they are believed to be free of copyright restrictions in the United States.
