  "longDescription": [
    "Gilbert Standerton learns that he has been disinherited by his cantankerous uncle, and is forced to find a way to provide for his newly-wedded high-society wife. After quitting his appointment at the Foreign Office, he develops a new interest in the stock market, and takes an avid interest in the antics of a gang of safe-cracking burglars. His wife becomes concerned as he frequently begins staying out late at night, and shows an unusual interest in a particular musical melody despite having lost interest in all of his other music interests. What strange skills has Gilbert acquired, and will he find his fortune without resorting to crime?",
    "The Melody of Death was published in 1915 and adapted for film in 1922."
